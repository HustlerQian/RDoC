Chief Complaint / HPI Chief Complaint (Patients own words)
Valentina is a 43-year old female with a past psychiatric history significant for an underlying depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, binge eating disorder, no history of prior inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations, no history of prior suicide attempts, no known history of self-injurious behavior, no history of EtOH or illicit-substance use and a past medical history significant for DVT (8-years ago while on OCP) who presents to the EDCRP for continued psychopharmacologic care following her transfer from Dr. Yvonne Ellison's practice.  Per Valentina, "I just need to continue these medications...they have been so helpful."
EtOH
++++++++++++++
In an effort to seek treatment, she began seeing dietician, Frida Gibbons in Hubert, who she states was "helpful, but not enough."  She subsequently purchased a diet book and worked through the exercises in the book and states that that, too, was helpful, but not enough.  She ultimately contacted one of the authors of the book and arranged to undergo therapy with her via Skype.  She states that that was helpful for approximately 6-months, at which time her therapist suggested that she seek local ED-specific care.  As such, she underwent an evaluation with Dr. Deon Yarbrough 6/2066 and was subsequently referred to Dr. Tonya Alston for a 20-week course of CBT-E.  Valentina states that her treatment with Dr. Alston was "phenomenal...it was exactly what I needed."  She concurrently began seeing Dr. Yvonne Ellison for psychopharmacologic treatment of her underlying depressive/anxiety disorder and BED.  She has since responded well to her current regimen of Zoloft, Vyvanse, and Topamax.
On further psychiatric review of symptoms, Valentina denies any curer nt feelings of depression and further denies all neurovegetative symptoms of depression.  She denies any symptoms consistent with mania or psychosis.  She denies any symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety and further denies any associated symptoms of panic.  She further denies any history of EtOH or illicit-substance use.

However, since her cancer diagnosis, her anxiety has greatly worsened. She reports feeling nervous during the day, and describes having had several panic attacks as well (shaking of her hands, tachycardia, worry, dyspnea). There is nothing in particular that worsens or triggers these attacks other than when she feels overwhelmed. She denies any avoidant behavior. On the contrary, she continues to enjoy a very active social life (lunch with friends, shopping with friends, etc.). She takes daily walks for 1-3 miles with her husband. Enjoys time with her adult children and grandchildren. Denies any neurovegetative symptoms other than diminished energy and occasional awakening at night. No thought, desire, or intent to harm herself or others. No si/sx of mania, psychosis, OCD. She has been taking lorazepam 0.25mg in the morning and 0.5mg in the afternoon/early evening with moderate effect.
She has also started seeing a therapist in St. Pauls (Virginia Quackenbush, PhD, RN) and has met her once with another appointment already scheduled. Suicidal Behavior Hx of Suicidal Behavior: No

He stated that at this point he began to consume 3/4 liter-1liter of vodka per day. He informed writer that in 2086 his wife lost her primary job and had their first child all in a short span, and that since then he has been the primary breadwinner, which is stressful. He stated that he tried to quit drinking for a one week cleanse in 2085, at which point he experienced withdrawal sx's such as tremors and confusion( denies seizures). He attended a 4 day detox in Dec 2089, at which point he was referred to KMSC for services. However, he stated the he did not follow up at the time b/c  "it was not the right time."
He presented today, stating that he drinks up to 1Lof vodka per night, and that he last drank 4-6ounces of vodka around 3AM( Pt showed  no signs of intoxication during intake, but did state that he was beginning to "feel crappy").

He stated that he is prescribed Lorazepam by his PCP for anxiety and that he will sometimes drink w/ them( writer informed pt of the danger of this). He reported no hi,si, plan or intent, and denied any history or familial history of suicide. He did report a positive Hx of substance abuse/ dependence in his family, stating that " my brother takes a lot of drugs( couldn't identify them), and remarked that "it is normal to drink a lot in my family." He also informed writer of multiple traumatic events in his past, including a personal traumatic event of a sexual nature at the age of 7( bother also endured event), and  the loss of 3 friends by suicide from 2080-2085.He stated that his alcohol dependence is having a negative inpact on his life, and reported that his wife and two small children are living apart from him until he gets treatment.

Patient served in infantry during his deployment to Antigua.  He reported experiencing several traumatic events, including the loss of three friends that were killed in action, providing medical assistance to severely wounded men and an IED explosion that resulted in his medical retirement.  He noted that all the traumatic experiences were re-occuring at similar frequencies currently.  He reported having daily intrusive thoughts about the IED event and avoids talking about the experiences whenever possible. He also reported discomfort in crowded areas and avoids fireworks.  Regarding shifts in cognitions and beliefs, patient noted being less trustful of others since his deployment.  He reported experiencing several arousal symptoms, disrupted sleep (ranging from 3 to 6 hours each night), hypervigilance, and difficulty concentrating.  On the PCL, patient's score of 62 provides additional support for a diagnosis of PTSD.  Regarding his mood, patient described feeling down for the past month, periods of feeling sad, a loss of appetite (without significant weight loss) and fequent negative self-evaluations.  He denied experiencing anhedonia or decreased motivation.    He denied having thoughts of suicide and noted that he would never make an attempt due to the pain it would cause his family.  Patient acknoweldged having passive thoughts of suicide in the past, including in September of 2091 when he was going through medication changes, and denied every having intent, plan, or attempts of suicide.
During his deployment, patient reported one experience of a head injury that was sustained in the IED blast.  He was an estimated 10 to 15 meters away when the IED went off in front of him.   He was informed that he lost consciousness and recalled "seeing black" then his next memory was waking up to chest pain from a sternum rub.  He was uncertain about the length of time he was unconscious and recalled having headaches, ringing in his ears, and mild levels of nausea and imabalance at the time.  He had difficulty recalling events immediately following the head injury but noted that the symptoms remitted after a few days and returned 1 to 2 weeks later.  He was adiministered the MASE exam and failed it multiple times, leading to 96 hours of rest before resuming his responsibilities. Patient denied receiving other medical attention while in country.  In 2090, patient was evaluated by the TBI clinic at Glenbeigh Hospital and diagnosed with mTBI and PTSD.  Patient was medically separated in 2091 and is currently 100% service connected, including for PTSD, TBI, chronic back pain, neck tinnitus, and joint pain.   Patient returned to TX in April of 2092 and is currently living with his parents, working as an employment counsellor, and in his second week of Veteran's Support at UC College.    He has been seeking treatment at Antioch Hospital in Whiteville for medical concerns and recently met with a psychiatrist and is awaiting an appointment for a therapist at the PTSD clinic.  Patient has also received a neurosurgery consult at ROM, leading to a recommendation for surgery (i.e. microsurgical decompression bilaterally with microdiscectomies or the same procudure and instrumented spinal fusion).  This was patient's fourth consult for managing lower back pain and is awaiting a fifth opinion at Antioch Hospital.

Patient reported early appointments (i.e. 8 a.m.) due to his work schedule.  Formulation:
Mr. Bruce Easter is a 23 year old veteran who is 100% SC (PTSD and TBI) related to a deployment in Antigua in 2089.  He reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of depressive disorder NOS, secondary to PTSD and chronic pain.   Patient's report of experiences of grief related to the loss of four friends suggests the need for further evaluation of complicated grief.  It appears that patient would benefit from trauma focused treatments; however a review of his records at Antioch Hospital revealed that patient had no showed several appointments to meet with a psychologist, Joanne Elder, PhD at the Veteran's Support Group as well as appointments for TBI at the polytrauma clinic.  It will be important to explore barriers to patient's engagement in treatments offered at Antioch Hospital.  Consultation with HB providers will follow to form treatment recommendations.  Substance Use Intervention Action Plan: None needed

See Dr. Payton's notes: Mom "had a breakdown" when pt was 11.  Pt learned from father later that mom had remembered sexual abuse by her father/pt's grandfather.  Pt remembers her mother as "incapacitated for a year; I would come home to find her crying in a closet and I couldn't get her out."  Pt's father, with PTSD from Vanuatu War, "didn't know how to do anything around the house", so pt reports that she cooked for and took care of her younger sister and brother, feeling terrified by her mother's behavior and by the "need to take care of everyone."

Last year, attempted to return to work at DuPont (EI Du Pont De Nemours).  Found the interpersonal interactions stressful- felt irritable, perceived co-workers as "stupid" or "unable to understand" her- and was surprised by this as she has not experienced those reactions before.  Pt wondering now if teaching is the best fit for this point in her life, especially as she feels increasing worried about children's safety since London Subway attacks, recent school shootings and other troubling aspects of local news.

Ulyses is looking for work and may require scheduling around work conflicts.Formulation:
Ulyses Yoshida is a 25yo single white heterosexual male who currently lives with his mother and step father in the family home in Incline Village-crystal Bay. Ulyses is currently seeking employment at ConocoPhillips and hopes to begin there soon. He recently moved to FL after living for several years in Indiana with his father. He reports the move was prompted by difficulties related to his substance use as he and his father were smoking pot daily and Ulyses, on his own, could drink up to 30 beers in one night. He reports his father is now living in Oklahoma and he speaks with him approx 1x a week. Ulyses reports he has not used marijuana since early february after getting caught by his family and told he would have to leave if he continues. He has been able to abstain but is doing so only because of the potential consequences. Ulyses is also maintaining fairly inconsistent use of alcohol (LU sunday ffor the playoffs while at home with step-father). He reports he has not had problems abstaining from using. Ulyses meets for both Cannabis Use Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder.

She denies withdrawal symptoms while drinking during her college years. This pattern continued until she found out she was pregnant.  At times prior to this she would avoid etoh due to obsessions that she could act inappropriately if drunk. After son was born she would drink once weekly or less. Around the divorce she started to drink 2x weekly up to 5 drinks each night.

Dx: Concerning for dementia of Alzheimer's type, history of subdural hematoma; seems more like apathy than depression (possible neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD)
His presentation is consistent with AD given the gradual insidious decline of cognition in the past 2-3 years, worsening functioning of basic IADLs at home, minimal encoding with no delayed recall after 5 minutes, worse semantic fluency than phonemic fluency, poor executive function for Trails, poor calculations despite being a PhD Retail Trade Supervisor, concominant apathy and possibly depression.

Pt reported, "My daughter has not been officially diagnosed as the therapist and neurologist are still trying to determine the underlying cause of my daughter's behavior. For the past year, we have been trying to determine if it is anxiety, ADHD, or learning problems. She is impulsive and has a very low frustration tolerance at home. When things don't go her way, she reacts in a way that does not match the problem. The best way I can describe it is she has a "fight" response. She is currently on Tenex (1mg) two tiimes per day. She has become very moody and irritable and her neurologist wants to explore a mood disorder. She has said on occasion, "I wish I were dead. Nobody loves me. You wish I was never born.!" She has severe sibling rivalry toward our four year old boy/girl twins (more so her brother). When she is alone or with only one sibling, her behavior is much improved.

George Joyner is a 22 y/o SWM who presents at the Psychiatry program for initial evaluation. Pt was seen here approx 1 year ago but had limited f/u and then left the state for tx in Ogallala. Limits of confidentialty were address. All questions were answered.
Goerge notes that last time was here he was "deep in addiction." Was trying to work through being a student and trying to get clean." It didn't work out, was living w/ others who were using." Could get 1 or 2 days clean. So he decided to return to Ogallala (Nov, 2093) and went to an IOP there and individual therapy, family therapy also. Had a successful experience. Has put together 9 months sobriety. Is back now, is working at DELPHI. Is planning on returning to Oregon State in January, 2095. George feels he had a good plan to keep sober - drug testing, release to parents, on vivitrol presently. Also knows he needs social supports to maintain his sobriety. Is interested in a group, participating in the program. Pt is currently living in Springdale - is living with roommates, none of them know him or his recovery story. Discussed substance use with roommates, but no other harder drugs or MJ. Pt chose to not live with roommates from school who drink/do coke. Is going to re-connect w/ other peers. Pt wants some sober friends. Did AA for approx 2-3 months in Ogallala had sponser, got to step 6 or 7 - didn't strick a chord with him around the spirituality. Is interested in starting WellPoint as alternative.

bright motivated Formulation:
George Joyner is a 22 y/o SWM who presents for an Psychiatry evaluation today. Pt was seen at Psychiatry on 11/12/93, but did not follow-up as he thought he would be able to manage his substance use issues on his own; however, pt continued using and relapsed significantly on opiates and returned to Ogallala and complete a residential program as well as IOP after-care, individual therapy, and family therapy. Pt has now returned to Vilnius to work at DELPHI and also re-enter Oregon State anticipation start date of Jan, 2095. Pt is sober 9 months and is doing well. Pt is looking for ongoing outpatient MH and substance use tx to maintain his gains. Pt notes some recent use of alcohol (1 x ) but is committed to not drinking or smoking, or any other drugs for next 1. Pt feels "I need to do this." Pt is engaging in mutual help programs - engaging in WellPoint also. He is living w/ roommates presently and has disclosed some of his substance use issues. Pt meets DSM-V criteria for Opioid Use Disorder - Severe, early full remission. He notes a hx of depression in the past, when he returned to Ogallala but feels this was secondary to his use of substances and also that he "failed school." He denies depression during periods of sobriety. His current BD score of 5 places his depression in the minimal range. He notes minimal anxiety and anger at present, also reflected by his low self-report measures. He appears motivated for recovery and sobriety. Pt has no hx of bipolar, psychosis, or SA, hospitalizations or other major mental health issues. He is medically stable. He is still connected with his therapist from Ogallala until he transitions to a therapist in Vilnius. He is taking vivitrol, which expires on 8/29. Pt has complicated insurance and this will likely need figuring out to see if this will pay for services here. Recommendations to follow. Substance Use Intervention Action Plan: Referral for specialized outpatient SUD evaluation

History of Present Illness and Precipitating Events
The pt is a 28 yo M with a history of BPAD, BPD, and social anxiety without agoraphobia who presents for intake into the MetroWest for his active opioid abuse. This is his first time seeking treatment for his drug abuse. He reports that since he moved here two years ago, he has been hanging around the wrong people.    He was first introduced to opioids by illicit prescription drug use (percocet, oxycodone and oxycontin) from a neighbor ("Ness") and in the past few months, it progressed to IV heroin use. He has been using IV heroin for the past 3-4 months.  He uses at least once a day. He is unable to quantify an amount, but he spends approximately $600 per month very easily; $140 every three days. His last use was last night at 10 pm. When asked how he pays for heroin, he states that he receive SSDI for his psychiatric disorders. He also alludes that has additional funds but remains elusive in regards to where/how they are obtained. When asked about other illicit drug use, the pt reports he used to smoke a lot of marijuana in high school and college. After his parents divorced, he lived with his mother. In 9th grade, he was marijuana smoking interfered with his concentration and he could not focus on anything, including his music lessons. He admits to still occasional use; his last use was before his father died last year. He denies any history of alcohol abuse. He smokes cigarettes 0.5 PPD.

He started Celexa about one year ago, initially at 10 mg, increased to 20 mg about two weeks ago in setting of increased depression compromising his ability to function at school. Seroquel 25 mg has been prescribed (but not yet started) to address persistent sleep difficulties.
He describes his moods as sad/down most days most of the time over the past month. His interests are very low with only transient pleasure/sense of motivation. He somewhat enjoyed visiting a friend out of town this past week and is looking forward to spring break and summer but mainly "I look forward to lying down". There is some diurnal variation with 11PM-4 AM his best times.

He is a worrier by nature but generally able to talk himself down with "pragmatic talk" (e.g., what is actual probability of...). He often worries about saying the wrong thing or making a fool of himself in social settings but this does not appear to have presented major obstacles or distress. Also subthreshold appear to be OCD symptoms such as symmetry (in the past), checking, and largely ego-syntonic perfectionism.
He drinks to excess, consistent with his classmates, about 5-6 drinks x 2 nights a week and up to 1 beer/day but has made an explicit and successful effort to cut back over the past two weeks. He denies memory blackouts or withdrawal symptoms. He has no particular cravings for EtOH and has not had difficulty reducing his intake.

In November until Feb she was out of work "for stress" and was told she needed to see a psychiatrist. Her PCP Dr Enright started her on Prozac in 2089 at 10 mg, increased to 20 mg/d. She began seeing Perrin Reynolds MSW in Eureka. They currently met q2weeks. She feels she is calmer on it. She no longer reports palpitations or of feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  She had urges to stay home, started to avoid stores. Symptoms occurred only at work.
Her work situation has been very stressful.  She worked at PepsiCo for years, became a Consultant, then was"demoted" in June 2089. She reports the position, which may have been eliminated, was essentially  filled by a man months later. She filed a suit with ACLU Dec 2089. She had previously reported him for some inappropriate behavior at work. She feels she was treated differently since. Initialy she filed on her own Jan 2090, then found an attorney who specializes in discrimination cases. She had hearing August 2090.  She is awaiting up to another year or so for ACLU's determination of whether it goes to court.

Pt reported symptoms consistent with possible complicated grief since the death of her maternal GM in 2075 and last 12 months of increase in stress due to mother's illness (multiple myeloma) and separation with ongoing divorce from her husband. Additionally, pt wants to spend more time with mother, but can not do so without interacting with the father and the latter is re-traumatizing pt (due to history of childhood physical and verbal abuse).
Another complexity is pt's EtOH Dependence. She reported 2-3 weeks of binges (2-3 vodkas per evening) with 1-2 weeks of sobriety in between. This has been a pattern for at least one year. Pt was engaged with outpatient SA treatment program in Feb this year. She does not though attend AA.

Impression Formulation:
Patient is 40 y/o, employed, separated female with family history of MDD (on mother's and father's side, including mother, father and brother), one suicide (father's side), EtOH Dependence (both parents) and own history of MDD/GAD/PMDD/EtOH Dependence, possible Complicated Grief and pain medication abuse, who presented for evaluation of PMDD. Patient is seeking consult in context of the peri menopause symptom worsening, stress of separation with imminent divorce and mother's illness, in addition to ongoing EtOH Dependence and ambivalent feelings about the psychiatric medication treatment. Patient has a history of various side effects on SSRIs (Lexapro) and SNRIs (Effexor, Cymbalta), but also a history of good treatment response with no side effects on Prozac. Patient has started second Prozac trial in Jul 2079. Two months of symptom tracking demonstrated baseline moderate symptoms during the month with severe premenstrual exacerbation. Patient is on 20mg of Prozac only for 5-6 weeks.

Patient has started second Prozac trial in Jul 2079. Two months of symptom tracking demonstrated baseline moderate symptoms during the month with severe premenstrual exacerbation. Patient is on 20mg of Prozac only for 5-6 weeks.
Given the history of good response to Prozac and also that SSRIs are used for treating MDD and PMDD, I recommend continuing the trial and increasing the Prozac dose till satisfactory clinical response is achieved. If no contraindications to the hormonal replacement therapy are present, patient could consider this treatment option, beneficial in addressing PMDD associated symptoms, but also some of the perimanopause symptoms. Alternatively, patients sleep, currently disturbed with night sweats, could be facilitated with Neurontin. Patient has additional challenge of EtOH Dependence, likely influencing the sleep quality, and contributing to anxiety as well as depression. Patient needs comprehensive treatment approach which should include: a) Outlined pharmacological treatment, b) Ongoing individual therapy, c) Substance abuse treatment, ideally in form of AA/sponsor.
EtOH
++++++++++++++
Due to patients complex family history including suicide and own history of childhood abuse,
MDD/GAD/PMDD/EtOH Dependence with ongoing high stressors, patient would likely be at high risk if deciding not to continue medication management and/or if comprehensive treatment plan as outlined above is not arranged.

A 28yo woman with no prior psychiatric history, and with a h/o T2N0M0 SCCA of right tongue s/p partial glossectomy and neck dissection on 8/20/76 referred to psycho-oncology to discuss adjustment to being cancer free for several years. The patient was diagnosed with SCCa of the right tongue in July 2076. She underwent two surgeries (including partial glossectomy and neck dissection) in August 2076 and all nodes were negative. She has not needed any treatment since. On a few occasions she noticed new bumps on her tongue. They are biopsied and all have been negative for cancer. When she has these bumps she worries about recurrence of her cancer. Otherwise she reports doing quite well in her life. She moved to Revere, NE 2 months ago to take a dream job at Houghton Mifflin. She moved in with her parents while she builds a new home. She called off a wedding 3 years ago and continues to be proud and pleased by this decision. She has had no panic attacks since the break-up. She currently is not in a relationship. He most important concerns are her job, her home, and getting back in shape. She reports normal sleep, energy, concentration, appetite. Denies any thought, desire, or intent to harm herself or others. No si/sx of mania, psychosis, panic, or OCD.

Pt has struggled to maintain any significant period of sobriety outside of highly structured settings.  Pt has engaged in various levels of care over past 1.5 years and was most successful when in a formal sober house with regular structure and treatment.  Currently unclear if Pt's roommate is sober, and lack of monitoring/accountability has already been problematic for Pt in this living situation (relapse for one week approx 3 wks ago).  Pt reports sobriety since admitted to the hospital approx 2 wks ago.  Pt has engaged in the IOP and is expressing motivation to be sober and it is reasonable to see if this level of care is adequate to support Pt's sobriety.  Although Pt is reporting no cravings to drink he is at high risk for relapse given his history and would benefit from an anticraving medication.  Discussed naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfram.  pt with preference for naltrexone with goal to try vivitrol once insurance changed.  Discussed risk/benefits associated with treatment with naltrexone including but not limited to elevation in LFTs, nausea, sedation, anhedonia, depressed mood, and thoughts of suicide.  when Pt's AST/ALT were last checked they were elevated although this was in the context of heavy drinking.  Last LFTs were within 3X normal limits, therefore will start naltrexone and closely monitor.

X normal limits, therefore will start naltrexone and closely monitor.
Psychiatrically Pt reports prior diagnosis of ADHD and endorses si/sx of anxiety since college.  Difficult to determine if Pt meets full criteria for ADHD given mild functional difficulties began in late adolescence, would benefit from neuropsych testing to assist with diagnostic clarification.  Additionally pt's panic attacks and general worries began in the context of regular cocaine use and more recently persistent EtOH use.  Pt has been stable on sertraline to target anxiety, will continue but will carefully monitor for si/sx of anxiety in sobriety since unclear if Pt's anxiety has been substance induced versus co-morbid illness.  Pt reports some general worries but they have not interfered with his concentration/focus or functioning.  Pt also reports periods of elevated mood and impulsive decisions when excited about social events.  Pt does not clearly meet criteria for manic episodes and has not had a clear past depressive episode, will also need to monitor his mood in sobriety to assist with diagnostic clarification.

Substance abuse and self-destructive behaviors used to mitigate her sense of emptiness and intolerance of affect.  Does not appear to be in current depressive episode.

"My anxiety is mostly related to physical symptoms and my fear of fainting"History of Present Illness and Precipitating Events
45 yo M with long-standing anxiety, EtOH abuse in remission, marijuana dependence in remission, no prior psychiatric care, no hospitalizations, no suicide attempts, who now presents for a psychotherapy intake after being referred by his PCP. He had a panic attack during our session and had to leave the room for 10 minutes. The patient describes anxiety throughout his life, mostly related to physical symptoms that he has. He states, "I think I'm a hypochondriac - I'll get a symptom, look it up on the internet, and get worried that it's caused by something like a tumor." He denies anxiety about non-health related concerns. He experiences panic attacks 1-2x/week with palpitations, lightheadedness, fear of fainting, nausea, and occasional SOB. These attacks will last from minutes to as long as a few hours. He has fainted during these attacks (thought to be due to vasovagal epsiodes) on four occasions and now feels like he has a "fear of fainting." When asked to explain this further he states, "I feel like fainting is a complete loss of control, and I'm a control person." He feels like losing control is a sign of failure. When he begins to have a panic attack he will become frightened of fainting and this will make his symptoms worse. He finds that he spends large amounts of time worrying about having a panic attack and fainting. He is not frightened of leaving the house or having a panic attack in public. The frequency of his panic attacks has increased in the last 8 months since having a newborn son at home. He states that he has been under increased stress because of caring for a newborn, having disrupted sleep, and running his business. He has noticed that his mood has been worse ("the anxiety is dragging me down") but denies depressed mood. He has difficulty falling back asleep at night when he wakes up, and he has experienced decreased energy during the day. He has been unable to stick to his usual routine of exercise and healthy eating recently. He denies changes in interest, concentration, or appetite. He denies SI/HI and does not have access to firearms.

Would like to do therapy because, "I don't want to depend on the medications." Formulation:
45 yo M with long-standing anxiety, EtOH abuse in remission, marijuana dependence in remission, no prior psychiatric care, no hospitalizations, no suicide attempts, who now presents for a psychotherapy intake after being referred by his PCP. The patient has symptoms consistent with panic disorder without agoraphobia and would like to try therapy to help with his symptoms. We will start him with a short course of CBT for panic disorder and then decide whether he may be a candidate for longer term therapy as well. He describes a large number of stressful interactions during his childhood and currently has patterns of "wanting to be in control" and perfectionism that he feels may be overly rigid.

25 yo Senegal F with EtOH UD severe, depressive disorder NOS, and GAD.  Pt is in early sobriety from ETOH, h/o significant difficulty achieveing sobriety outside of highly structured settings.  Pt would benefit from medication to target EtOH UD given severity of illness and need to be fully sober to regain custody of son.  Pt is currently not interested in medication and denies experiencing cravings.  Will closely monitor Pt's substance use.  Encouraged engagement in groups at residential living facility and indiv therapy to build relapse prevention skills.  Pt also endorses h/o persistently depressed mood, recently associated with neuroveg si/sx of depression, no SI.  Additionally Pt endorses general worries, primarily focused on son and relationship with boyfriend (father of baby).  Although Pt reports her mood has been improving in current residential facility with increased independence Pt would benefit from medication to target depression and anxiety given need to demonstrate to CPS capacity to manage stress without EtOH use to regain custody.  Pt identifies that her mood and anxiety have significantly contributed to relapses with EtOH.  Discussed SSRIs as medication that can target both disorders. recommended trial of sertraline, discussed risk/benefit and potential side effects including but not limited to sedation, GI distress, HA.  Pt initially expressed unwillingness for medication trial but with education decided she would try medication for more support.  Pt will need continued psychoeducation and close follow up to support adherence to medication and to build her understanding of the role of medication in addition to therapy to support stability in sobriety.  Insomnia likely secondary to depression and anxiety, will start trazodone to target while waiting for sertraline to become efficacious.Patient Instructions

Biologically, patient has genetic loading for unipolar depressive disorder; has long standing dysthymia; and can have neuropsychiatric contributors from current weekend alcohol binges and frequent cannabis use. There are no update labs in chart, therefore, will provide lab slip on next appt to r/o any organic contributors (VtD, TSH, Free T4, B12) to her affective sxs. As for her substance use, patient was educated on its adverse effects, particularly on her susceptible brain, of which she relayed understanding and was very agreeable to completely removing alcohol and significantly cutting down on cannabis. Patient was also educated on the suboptimal effects of psychotropic if continuing to use substance, which she relayed understanding and again agrees to cut out. Pharmacologically, it was recommended to increase citalopram, given previous efficacy on initiation, and continuation of lamotrigine as adjunct antidepressant. Goal is to eventually decreases lamotrigine to lowest effective dose or even remove if no difference is noted in affective upon down titration. There are no concerns at present for a cycling mood disorder.

30 yo divorced male with EtOH dependence, opioid dependence, nicotine dependence, depression, h/o SA presents for psychopharm evaluation.  Pt's childhood notable for chaotic environment, abuse, maternal substance abuse.  Pt has struggled with depression, opioid and EtOh dependence for several years, no h/o consistent treatment since late teens.  Pt is currently motivated to be sober but has few recovery coping skills and is at high risk to relapse with substance use.  Additionally Pt continues to have si/sx of depression and general worries which has been exacerbated by lack of daytime structure.  Pt reports headache over past six weeks which he attributes to sertaline.  Unclear if headache from sertaline since would have expected headache to subside by now.  Unclear utility in use of neurontin which also has potential for misuse.  Will continue to assess psychotropic medications to target depression and anxiety at next appt.  today focused on decreasing risk for relapse with EtOH and opioids by starting naltrexone to target cravings.  Discussed risk/benefit of treatment with naltrexone and side effects including but not limited to anhedonia, depression, increased suicidal ideation, and stomach upset.  Continue to encourage engagement in IOP and will work on helping Pt connect with indiv therapy since he is at high risk for self harm if he relapses given h/o several suicide attempts while intoxicated.  No acute risk to harm self or others currently, Pt is motivated and engaged in treatment, currently appropriate for outpatient level of care.

Reported he had a slip one week ago and took a 8 mg tablet of suboxone orally.  Reported he was having strong cravings to use opioids after a friend died of an overdose two weeks ago, also reported feeling depressed and fighting with father as triggers/stressors.  Pt has continued to have passing thoughts about using percocets a couple times a day, distracts himself as a way of coping with thoughts.  Pt has been using AA to support sobriety, does not find meetings helpful ("boring") but finds being part of the community and having sober friends is helpful.  Prior to use of suboxone last week Pt had been sober for the past two months.  Longest period of sobriety was for 5 mths from October 2065 until approx Feb 2066 after Pt had a car crash while high and was psychiatrically hospitalized at Hoffman Clinic.  Pt has been using opioids since age 17, h/o using heroin IV.  Negative for Hep C and HIV (last tested in mid Nov 2065, no use of needles since).  No h/o suboxone or methadone treatment.  No h/o overdose on opioids, h/o significant intoxication with EtOH and benzodiazepines in college requiring ED visit.

Pt first experienced depressed mood in 7th grade which he related to poor school performance and conflict with parents.  Reported his mood began "cycling" in 8th grade.  Pt reported when his mood is up ("manic") he feels overconfident, more aggressive, talks more loudly, speech increased, can't sit still, more impulsive, increased libido, makes impulsive purchases, has more difficulty falling asleep although is still sleeping several hours per night.  Pt reported periods of "mania" last for two to three days.  Reported he typically goes from feeling depressed for two to three weeks to feeling manic for two to three days.  Pt was started on seroquel 100 mg Qam, 200 mg QHS for mood stabilization during his psych hospitalization in October 2065.  Reported he took seroquel for 3 mths, stopped briefly, restarted in Feb/March.  Feels seroquel has helped to keep him balanced.  Has noticed that he feels tired after taking the medication and his appetite has been increased but denied weight change.  Briefly took depakote while psychiatrically hospitalized but does not want to take, "Other patients told me it was bad for me."  No prior trials of lithium, tegretol, or trileptal.
Onset of Pt's ADHD symptoms predate his substance use.  Onset of mood symptoms did occur around Pt's first substance use.  Pt first started using substances in middle school but Pt reported only drank a few times in 6th and 7th grade.  Pt reported his substance use escalated in the summer between 8th and 9th grade when he began smoking cannabis frequently, "I was smoking a ton of marijuana in the summer going into 9th grade."  Used cannabis daily in high school, drank EtOH on weekends.  Sniffed cocaine a few times during his freshman year of high school but disliked, reported he felt withdrawn after using cocaine, and use felt similar to how he felt on adderall.

age appropriate intensive outpatient program Formulation:
20 yo male with opioid dependence, EtOH dependence, Bipolar disorder, ADHD, and anxiety presents for psychopharm evaluation.  Family history significant for substance use, bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety.  Pt with significant psychiatric symptoms and polysubstance use since middle school.  In addition to recent IV heroin use Pt with h/o regular cannabis use as an adolescent, combined EtOH and benzodiazepine use in late teens.  Pt substance use and psychiatric symptoms have led to three inpatient hospitalizations, most recently in March 2065.  Pt has been able to maintain some sobriety after hospitalization and while on seroquel for mood stabilization.  Pt recently used suboxone once in context of friend's death.  Pt guarded during evaluation today therefore difficult to fully assess mood and Pt appears to potentially confuse si/sx of ADHD and mania when reporting symptoms.  Will need to carefully observe and monitor Pt's mood and provide psychoeducation on target symptoms of depression, mania, and ADHD.  Given risk of activation to mania with stimulant treatment and Pt's substance use history will prioritize treatment of Pt's mood before targeting ADHD.  Pt with significant si/sx of ADHD, significant fidgeting today although difficulty to tell if only due to ADHD versus anxiety as well.  Pt would benefit from medication to target cravings to use opioids since he is at high risk for relapse, discussed naltrexone PO and IM.  Pt generally hesitant around medication, discussed mood stabilizers, strategies for treatment of ADHD, nonbenzodiazepine options for treatment of anxiety, and naltrexone.  Priority is Pt's adherence to mood stabilizer, will switch seroquel all to QHS to improve adherence.  Will continue to discuss psychopharm options to optimize treatment of pt's co-morbid disorders.

Please note above history in comparison to intake by Dr. Henry 3/2/03
72 y/o woman with opioid dependence, MDD, anxiety with panic attacks, chronic pain who self presents to EJM for medication evaluation for treatment of opioid dependence.  The patient states that she first began using oral opioids after a severe car accident in 2064.  She was in a coma for 3.5 months and had injuries to her back and legs.  She was able to recover but unable to stop using opioids which she would buy from friends.  She denies a history of IVDU.  At peak in her sixties, she began to inhale heroin intranasally for 2-3 weeks.  She did not like the way it made her feel (jittery) and gained insight that she might have a problem.  She sought treatment at that time at a methadone clinic in Brinkley (MS).  This provided good relief and she was well connected to the clinic.  However, after 15 years with the clinic, she had a disagreement over whether she could continue receiving "home packs" of methadone and transferred her care to Milwaukee Sanitarium in April 2102.  She did not go to the Milwaukee Sanitarium methadone clinic for more than a 1-2 weeks because she became concerned that some patients may recognize her and know her grandchildren.  She has since been buying methadone 20 mg daily from friends.  States it is easy for her to obtain.  She would like to try suboxone given she is worried about being recognized in the community.  She denies a history of EtOH abuse, tobacco use, or other illicits.  She denies a history of mood symptoms but feels anxious in many domains of her life.  She also has had panic attacks occuring 2-3 times per month (palpitations, feeling faint).

73 yo without FH for SUD or MH condition describes drug free history until MVA with injuries leading to opiate Rx then methadone then illicit use of methadone (?clinics inconvenient).  Patients claims adherence to Rx dosing even when taking illicitly.  Tells me she has never exceeded 35mg/d methadone and worked with clinic to taper to 11/day until one month ago when she "stopped cold turkey"   Musculoskeletal pain from MVA and recent R wrist trauma result in chronic pain that supposedly drives her use.  Confusing is her decision to solicit methadone illicitly for years and "try heroin for two weeks (Dr. Humphrey intake...she did not mention this to me)
My impression is she will benefit from low dose Suboxone Rx and the therapeutic environment of EJM.  No indication for mood medication changes of Dr. KenneyPatient Instructions

PCP Dr Ellsworth
++++++++++++++
55 year old married father of 3, is referred by his PCP Dr Ellsworth for interim care. No prior psychiatric history. he presented to Dr Ellsworth in January with trouble sleeping, acute anxiety and trouble focusing. Pt relates this to a number of issues with his children coming together all at once with more realistic worries. Children are all more stable now which has helped him. Dr Ellsworth started him on celexa 20 mg daily, finds he has "weird dreams" if he misses a dose or 2 but otherwise tolerating it well. Is not sure whether it is the medication of less life stress which is contributing to his feeling better (likely both). Sleep is better, less anxious.  Denies increase in alcohol use, usual is a one scotch most days, occasionally 2. Uses lorazepam now occasionally, aware not to combine with alcohol,
Overall, feels better than he did in January. Would be interest in some counseling focused on stress management and stress resilience. In general a good coper, not often  feeling overwhelmed as he did this winterSuicidal Behavior Hx of Suicidal Behavior: No

Currently euthymic, though mildly constricted in affect and remains guarded.  May have ADHD, but have asked that she get neuropsych testing to confirm diagnosis, particularly with stimulants and eating disorder and cocaine use disorder.  Concern for insight, and only willingness to engage at the urging of CPS.  Will need to work on engagement and alliance.

Impression Formulation:
67 year old male with a history of high risk prostate cancer (stage T2Nx) no metastatic disease.  He had a co,plicated course with falls and dizziness and gait unsteadiness so he was refered for neurology appt as well as otoneurology.  He had a MRI scan with ventriculomegaly but similar to study from 2072; he also had an EEG at LTMC in Nov 2081 with abnomalities of L frontotemporal slowing with intermittent bursts of frontally predominant generalized delta activity.  There is also a history of cerebral trauma in past secondary to football injuries which as Dr. Istre suggested "may contribute to persistent dizziness...inner ear dysfunction and to depression."  He also has a signficant history of two major deaths in his family in a short time which he reports has caused him significant depression.  His history of mood stymptoms were not well defined due to the short time of our appt due to his being late, but his ability to give a linear history was also challenging.  It seems that there also may be some mood symptoms in his family but again this needs to be explored more.  His prominent symptoms are now depression with trouble concentrating and with sadness and some somatic symptoms of stomach upset and nausea when talking about losses.  One medication choice to consider with him would be lamotrigine given that it is a mood stabilzer(and hypomania with distractibility also possible) and the fact that it is indicated for bipolar depression and an antiseizure medication could also be beneficial given his EEG abnormalities.  I will see him again, asked him to follow up in 1-2 weeks and will contact his medical team to see if lamotrigine may be well tolerated.  I would also recommend that he continue to be seen by Mr. Izquierdo if possible for ongoing support.   [report_end]

7. He has refused to go for treatment other than to the Fairview, but recently told her he has started coming to MedCare Groups in the afternoon. She was unsure of what group. She worries that he is afraid of being rejected or not loved if he tells the truth. He tried accupuncture and massage once refusing to go back as he reported the massages Erwin gives him are better.

Psychiatric intake visit
++++++++++++++
Patient began college in 2078 at Arcadia University. After about 1.5 years in a computer science major, patient dropped out and returned to live with parents in Montana (where he stayed until 2082). At that time, patient moved back to Tirane and enrolled in college again (Dean College) in the communications program.  Patient was also married in 2082, but separated after 3 years (divorced in 2086).  It is noteworthy that patient was homeless for 3 months after divorce.  He dropped out of college after 1.5 years and began seeing a social worker for therapy and a psychiatrist for what he believed was ADHD (and possibly a learning disorder) and depression. Patient was tried on Ritalin (did not respond well), Celexa (not helpful), Concerta (not helpful), and possibly Dexedrin (he cannot recall). He stayed with this psychiatrist for about 1.5 years. Since patient was homeless at the time, he fell out of treatment.
Between 2087 and 2094, patient worked number of jobs: in 911 dispatching, as an optician assistant, and as an admin assistant. In 2094-2095, patient trained as car mechanic in Tirane. He was in a long-term relationship from 2092 until July 2097.  Patient was engaged, but ended the relationship in July 2097.  He feels that ADHD was, in part, a factor in relationship ending. Patient has now been dating his current girlfriend (who he lives with) for the past year. He was out of mental treatment for 8-10 years until he became frustrated with symptoms of ADHD once again. He then came into psychiatric care Sammy Yoakum, MD, PhD at ONH. It was at this time when he was started on Concerta (was ineffective) and then Adderall (ER 20mg BID) which was more helpful for him. Also was started on Wellbutrin SR for depression and residual symptoms of ADHD (200mg QDaily and 100mg Q1PM) and Namenda (was helpful for his short team memory, but was stopped because of insuance reasons and side effects - specifically difficulty with urination). He has been on these medication (with the exception of Namenda) since that time. Patient last saw Sammy Yoakum at ONH 1.5 months ago. This was the last time that the patient got a prescription for Adderall. As a result, he has been "rationing" his Adderall medication for the past two weeks. Switched psychiatrists because his PCP changed to Minden Medical Center and because he wanted to see an "ADHD expert."

Patient was slightly irritated with the psychiatry team today. He reported that he switched to Minden treaters about 1 year ago for primarily psychiatric reasons. However, he has not been able to see a psychiatrist in the Minden Center since that time. Patient has been seeing Mark Izquierdo, PhD for therapy (CBT for ADHD) since 2/2098, which he reports has been effective. He is, however, not sure how much longer he will need therapy. Patient had a psychiatric intake appointment in 7/2098 with Dr. Fields, but did not keep the appointment because he "forgot." He was frustrated when he was told that he would have to wait 6 months to see Dr. Fields again Patient was happy to be seeing a psychiatrist today.

Reports that he has noticed a worsening of his ADHD symptoms since he began "rationing" his Adderall medication. States that he had "weight gain, a lack of focus and a lack of sensability." He is unsure whether his Wellbutrin is still necesary. The medication was originally prescribed for mild symptoms of depression and for continued symptoms of ADHD (while on Adderall). He reports that, ideally, he would not need to take any medication for ADHD. Patient plans to begin taking a multivitamin supplement called N-power plus (from Pills4U.com) for ADHD with the hope that he can eventually taper Adderall.
